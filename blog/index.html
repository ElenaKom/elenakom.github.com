	<h1>That's My Story!</h1>
	<p>Hi! My name is Elena. I immigrated to the U.S. in 2006 to further my educational ambitions and open doors to new opportunities I might have never had access to in Russia, my native country. I grew up during a period of great transition in Russia as the Cold War and Communism came to an end. Despite the discouragement I received from my family I decided in my late teens that I would travel to the U.S. to study and hopefully make a new life there in a world completely different from the one Iâ€™d grown up in.</p>
